    <h1 id="chap1">Rose</h1>
    <p>The rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow rose and sometimes white or purple rose. Roses are widely used across the world as symbols of love, sympathy or sorrow. Most roses have spines (incorrectly called prickles) on their stems. This is a common defense system in plants.</p>

    <h1 id="chap2">Thulip</h1>
    <p>Tulips are spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes in the Tulipa genus. Tulip flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white. They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals, internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.</p>
